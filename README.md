# text encryption

simple, secure text encryption in your browser.

## how it works

- uses **aes-256 encryption** via crypto-js
- everything happens **locally in your browser**
- no data is sent to any server
- automatically generates secure random keys
- or use your own custom key

## why it's safe

- **client-side only** – your data never leaves your device
- **industry-standard encryption** – same algorithm used by governments and banks
- **no tracking, no storage** – nothing is saved or logged
- **open source** – inspect the code yourself

## use cases

- encrypt sensitive notes
- share secrets securely (share encrypted text + key separately)
- protect passwords before copying to clipboard
- secure messages in untrusted environments

## languages

- english (en)
- polski (pl)

auto-detects your browser language.
